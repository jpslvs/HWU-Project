  annote    = {The authors of this paper investigate the relation between human
              performance in an IVE and the size of the cursor, object and controller.
              The \emph{cursor} here refers to the graphical object that maps the input device
              (controller) to the virtual world. A study was performed to arrive at two
              conclusions. The first (\emph{the relative size hypothesis}) states that the
              \textbf{interplay} between the size of the controller, cursor, and object has a direct
              effect on the performance in the virtual environment rather than the size of
              the controller, cursor or the object \textbf{alone}. The second hypothesis that was proved
              shows that only the orientation time was fastest when the controller and cursor
              were largest. This study can help us during the development of our UI system. The
              3D pointer that was developed probably should be a little larger than its current
              size.}
